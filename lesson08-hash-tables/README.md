# Lecture 1: Introduction to Hash Tables

## Warm-up (10 minutes)

## Written Question (5 minutes)
<!--Khalid: This intro question assumes they know about hash tbales  -->

What problems do you think can arise from having duplicate keys in a hash table? Discuss why unique keys are essential.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

Introduce the concept of hash tables, explaining how they use a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be stored or searched. Cover the basics:

### Definition and Use:

Explain what hash tables are and why they are used.

### Components of Hash Tables:

Discuss keys, values, hash functions, buckets, and collisions.

### Hash Function:

Describe how keys are converted into array indices.

### Handling Collisions:

Briefly introduce methods like chaining and open addressing.

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)

Give students a problem to implement a basic hash table using chaining to handle collisions. Encourage them to consider what happens when two keys hash to the same index.

## Recap (15 minutes)

Review key concepts and answer any questions. Summarize how hash tables operate efficiently and why choosing a good hash function is critical to minimize collisions.
