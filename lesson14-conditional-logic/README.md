# Lesson 1: Introduction to Conditional Logic

Daily Lesson Structure

## Warm up (10 minutes):

## Written Question (5 minutes):
<!-- Khalid: I might do continue and break in here since they will probably already know conditional logic. We can show more advanced control flow and common control flow techniques like early returning and how to cascade logic -->
"Why do we use conditional statements in programming?" Post the question in Slack, have everyone submit their answers simultaneously after a 5-minute timer.

## Topic Overview (20 minutes):

Basic Conditional Statements: Introduce if, else, and else if statements. Explain the syntax and how these statements control program flow based on boolean conditions.

Examples: Show simple examples, like checking if a user is eligible to vote based on age.

## Problem Solving (35 minutes):

Problem Focus: Given the price of a lemonade and the amount a customer pays, determine how much change to give back.
Activities:
Pseudocode: Write pseudocode for handling various payment scenarios (exact amount, more, or less).
Code: Implement the pseudocode in a suitable programming language.
Reflection: Discuss what happens if conditions are not met or are incorrectly implemented.

## Recap (15 minutes):

Review the written quiz question.
Solution Review: Go over the coding solution and discuss different scenarios that were handled.
Feedback Submission: Encourage feedback on the session.
Resources:

Code editor or IDE setup for live coding.
Example snippets and cheat sheets on conditional logic.

### Learning Deliverables:

Understand the basic use of conditional statements.
Apply simple if-else logic to solve a practical problem.
