# Lesson 28: Using Arrays to Identify Anagrams
<!-- Khalid: I'm not sure what this lesson is asking in terms of using an array for anagrams -->
## Warm-up (15 minutes):

### Syntax Problem (10 minutes)

### Written Question (5 minutes):

"How can arrays help in reducing the complexity of problems involving character comparison, such as finding anagrams?"

### Topic Overview (20 minutes):

#### Understanding Anagrams:

Define what anagrams are and why they are interesting in both linguistics and computer science.

#### Array Utilization in Anagrams:

Explain how to use arrays for character frequency counting and how this helps in efficiently determining if two strings are anagrams.

### Problem Solving (35 minutes):

Implementation Task: Students will write a function that uses an array to determine if two strings are anagrams.
Activities:
Pseudocode: First, outline the approach using pseudocode.
Coding: Implement the anagram check function.
Reflection: Discuss how the use of arrays simplified the problem.

### Recap (15 minutes):

Review the Written Question: Discuss the array's role in simplifying the comparison of characters in strings.
Problem Review: Review the solutions provided by students, highlighting efficient practices and common pitfalls.
Feedback Submission: Encourage students to submit feedback on the clarity and challenge level of the lesson.
Resources:

Examples of anagrams and non-anagrams to use as test cases.
Cheat sheets for array methods useful in manipulating character data.
Learning Deliverables:

Students will understand the use of arrays in solving problems that involve character data manipulation.
They will develop the ability to apply array operations in practical programming problems, enhancing their problem-solving toolkit.
