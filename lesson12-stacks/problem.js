/**
 * Khalid: Maybe we should simplify this question to just '('
 * Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
 * determine if the input string is valid.
 *
 * A string is considered valid if:
 * 1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
 * 2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
