# Lesson #: Sliding Scale (Problem Solving Methodology)

## Warm-up (10 minutes)
Quick review: What methods do you use to iterate through arrays in JavaScript? Take a moment to write down: for loop, forEach, map, and filter.

Write a basic for loop that sums numbers in an array.
## Written Question (5 minutes)
What's wrong with this code for finding a subarray sum?

```javascript
function findSum(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
    if(sum === target) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)
Sliding Window is a technique to solve array/string problems with contiguous elements. Instead of re-computing overlapping subarrays, we maintain a "window" that slides through the data.

Key concepts:

1. Window boundaries (start, end)
2. Window state (sum, count, etc.)
3. Window movement rules

Example: Find max sum of 3 consecutive elements
```javascript
function maxSum(arr, k) {
    let windowSum = 0;

    // Initial window
    for(let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += arr[i];
    }

    let maxSum = windowSum;

    // Slide window
    for(let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - arr[i-k] + arr[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Practice problems:

1. Find longest substring without repeating characters
2. Find smallest subarray with sum â‰¥ target
3. Calculate moving average of last N numbers

Let's solve #1 together:
<!-- Khalid: For the sake of time they could be left with the code and we go over everything during the recap so they have more time to code -->
```javascript
function longestSubstring(str) {
    let seen = new Map();
    let start = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    for(let end = 0; end < str.length; end++) {
        if(seen.has(str[end])) {
            start = Math.max(start, seen.get(str[end]) + 1);
        }
        seen.set(str[end], end);
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

## Recap (15 minutes)
- Sliding Window optimizes subarray operations
- Key: maintain window state while sliding
- Common problems: subarray sums, substring patterns
- Time complexity usually O(n)
