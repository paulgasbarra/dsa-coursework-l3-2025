# Lecture 2: Advanced Hash Table Operations

## Warm-up (10 minutes)

## Written Question (5 minutes)
<!-- Khalid: This theory might be too advanced, might be better served with a deeper discussion about time complexity for hash tables. -->

What is the load factor in a hash table and how does it affect performance?

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

Dive deeper into hash table operations and performance tuning:

### Load Factor:

Definition and its impact on performance. Explain when to resize a hash table.

### Resizing a Hash Table:

Discuss how and why a hash table might need resizing, including what rehashing involves.

### Complexity Analysis:

Discuss the average and worst-case time complexities for insertions, deletions, and searches.

### Advanced Collision Resolution Techniques:

Brief overview of techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)

Challenge students with a task to implement a hash table that resizes itself based on the load factor. This will involve calculating the load factor and writing a rehash function.

### Recap (15 minutes)

Recap the dayâ€™s lesson focusing on why managing the load factor and choosing the right collision resolution technique can drastically affect the performance of a hash table.
