# Lesson 15: Advanced Conditional Logic (Nested and Multi-level Conditionals)

## Warm Up (10 minutes):

## Written Question (5 minutes):

"What are nested conditionals and when might you use them?" Everyone posts their answer simultaneously after a 5-minute timer.

## Topic Overview (20 minutes):
<!-- Khalid: I would cover left associativity here -->

### Nested Conditionals:

Introduce concepts of nesting if statements within others and using logical operators (&&, ||).

### Real-World Application:

Discuss scenarios where complex decision-making is necessary, like determining discounts based on multiple criteria.

### Problem Solving (35 minutes):

Problem Focus: Extend the lemonade stand problem to include discounts for regular customers or extra charges for special ingredients.
Activities:
Pseudocode: Handle multiple pricing scenarios using nested conditionals.
Code: Implement the complex logic in code.
Reflection: Reflect on the challenges of maintaining readability and logic integrity with nested conditionals.

## Recap (15 minutes):

Review the written quiz question from the start of class.
Solution Review: Discuss the extended problem and its solutions.
Feedback Submission: Gather feedback on the clarity and challenge of the session.
Resources:

Advanced examples of nested conditionals.
Interactive exercises to practice multilevel conditional logic.
Learning Deliverables:

Mastery of nested and multilevel conditional statements.
Ability to apply complex decision-making logic in programming tasks.
