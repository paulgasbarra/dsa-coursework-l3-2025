# Lesson 28: Bucket Sort with Arrays
<!-- Khalid: bucket sort might be too much for 20 minutes of lecture. Maybe switch this out for merge sort? -->
## Warm-up (15 minutes):

### Syntax Problem (10 minutes):

### Written Question (5 minutes): "What are the advantages of using bucket sort over other sorting algorithms for specific types of data?"

## Topic Overview (20 minutes):

Introduction to Bucket Sort: Explain the concept of bucket sort, including its best case and worst-case scenarios. Discuss when and why it is useful compared to other sorting methods.
How It Works: Break down the algorithm into stepsâ€”creating buckets, distributing elements based on a rule (e.g., range or size), sorting elements in each bucket, and then concatenating them.
Problem Solving (35 minutes):

Implementation Task: Students will implement bucket sort in JavaScript to sort an array of randomly generated integers.
Activities:
Group Discussion: Briefly discuss how to choose the number of buckets and the range of each bucket.
Coding: Write the function to perform bucket sort.
Reflection: Review and discuss the efficiency of the sort based on different inputs.
Recap (15 minutes):

## Review the Written Question: Discuss answers from the warm-up activity and reinforce why bucket sort is effective for specific data distributions.

Problem Review: Go over the bucket sort implementation and troubleshoot common issues that arose during the coding exercise.
Feedback Submission: Gather feedback to adjust future lessons on sorting algorithms.
Resources:

Visual aids showing the bucket sort process.
Sample code snippets for creating and sorting within buckets.
Learning Deliverables:

Students will understand how bucket sort operates and why it is efficient for data with known distribution characteristics.
Students will gain practical experience implementing bucket sort in JavaScript.
