<!--Khalid: part 3 won't fit in a 20 minute block. I could get through a part of the performance optimization section -->
### Advanced String Concepts
1. Regular Expressions
   - Pattern matching
   - Common regex patterns
   - test() and exec() methods
   - replace() with regex

2. String Encoding
   - ASCII vs Unicode
   - UTF-8 and UTF-16
   - Character encoding issues

3. Advanced String Operations
   - String matching algorithms
   - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm
   - Boyer-Moore algorithm
   - Rabin-Karp algorithm

### Performance Optimization
- String concatenation strategies
- Using StringBuilder pattern
- Memory efficiency
- Common pitfalls

### Real-world Applications
